# Dark-Mode-Website-Trial

## [Live Page Link](https://Abrahman-ra.github.io/Dark-Mode-Website-Trial)

So, Basically I tried the idea of making a button that changes the website mode from light to dark. There is a "dim mode" which is a state between completely light and completely dark modes.

### Abbreviations

- Pop-up related sections will be referred to as "pu" in HTML IDs & JS variables
- Button will be referred to as "Btn"
- Webpage related sections will be referred to as "wb" in HTML IDs & JS variables
