# Dark-Mode-Website-Trial

## [Live Page Link] [(https://Abrahman-ra.github.io/Dark-Mode-Website-Trial)]

So, Basically I tried the idea of making a button that changes the website mode from light to dark. There is a "dim mode" which is a state between completely light and completely dark modes.

## I know the page responsiveness cry in the corner. I will learn CSS later

My main concern is to apply my understanding of JS

## I will update the project soon to save the settings in the local storage
